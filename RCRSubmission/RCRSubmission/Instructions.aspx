  INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS 
 </b>
</p>
<p>
1.	Submissions will be an outline of the proposed learning session. If the outline is accepted, authors will then design the full learning session following the principles described here. Indicators of a quality proposal are described in the attached scoring rubric. Submit a proposal outline online.
</p>
<p>
2.	Proposal Review Schedule:
</p>
<p>
Proposals will be reviewed on the first of every month by the associate editor assigned that topic area.  Submission authors will be notified by email within 2 months. Possible proposal responses:
</p>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Rejection - poor proposal</li>
  <li>Accepted proposal – topic assigned and closed</li>
  <li>Rejection due to closed topic but good proposal – resubmit for new topic.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>
Once the final session proposal has been accepted, authors have 3 months to deliver the completed session design. 
</p>
<p>
3.	Our goal is to offer high quality, evidence based, interactive learning sessions instead of didactic lectures.  Learners retain much more content when actively engaged during a session.  If you have not read “The Brain Rules” by John Medina, please review the contents at this link: The Brain Rules.  Please pay close attention to the timing requirements to retain memory.
</p>

 <b>
  Preparing Your Presentation after Accepted Proposal
 </b>
</p>
<p>
1.	As part of your session design, please include case studies that allow for problem solving and that illustrate your key learning points. Examples of problem solving include questions that can be answered in small groups or using audience response systems.  Information on session design is available here (link to sample presentation and facilitator’s guide).
</p>
<p>
2.	If using PowerPoint slides as part of your design, please make them lean on text, illustrative, and have them present key points and evidence without overwhelming the viewer.  Begin your session with the key learning points the session will develop. Be sure to include summary slides that repeat and clarify those presented at the beginning. An outstanding session may have as few as 10-20 slides.
</p>
<p>
3.	Use video and/ or still images as much as possible to illustrate examples.  Content must be your own or used by written permission of the original owner. You’ll need to submit an intellectual property permissions form with your presenation. 
</p>
<p>
4.	Develop a quiz of at least 5 questions tied to the key learning points of your session.  This can be used before and/or after the session.  An answer key should be provided with a short explanation paragraph to explain the answers.
</p>
<p>
5.	All learning sessions will be submitted with the following technical specifications:
</p>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>Slides - as PowerPoint files (2003 or higher) or Prezi website presentation</li>
  <li>Word documents – Word 2003 or higher</li>
  <li>PDF documents</li>
  <li>Video content as WMV (preferably in 1280 x 720 HD resolution) files or uploaded to YouTube as a private link</li>
  <li>Other creative cross-platform media (i.e. apps, e-books, etc.)</li>
 </ul>
